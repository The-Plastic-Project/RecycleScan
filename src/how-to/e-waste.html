    <div class="regular-text" style="margin-bottom: 30px;"> All e-waste containing batteries (especially lithium
      batteries) cannot be disposed of in a normal recycling bin! This is because electronics and fluorescent lights
      need special disposal to handle the heavy metals and chemicals inside. They can be dropped off at special
      locations or events, or household hazardous waste collection points across the US. Find a local one here:

        For rechargeable batteries, consider investing in a rechargeable battery charger to reduce the number of
