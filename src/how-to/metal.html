    <div class="article-text">
      For the most part, metal can be recycled, but there some
      exceptions where it should be in the garbage. The following guidelines apply to the City of Kirkland and should
      apply broadly to other cities as well.

    </div>

    <div class="article-heading"> Metal Cans </div>
    <div class="article-text"> Aluminum and tin cans are recyclable, but only recycle metal
      lids that are larger than three inches. </div>

    <div class="article-heading"> Scap Metal </div>
    <div class="article-text"> Scrap metal needs to fit specific dimensions to be recycled.
      Scrap metal put in your blue recycling bin should be larger than three inches, but no longer than 2 feet. If your
      metal is too large, find a local scrap mill or US designated transfer station for the metal. For more specific
      guidelines, see the following page:

    </div>
    <div class="article-heading"> Foil and pie trays </div>
    <div class="article-text"> Tin foil / aluminum foil and pie trays are NOT recyclable in
      Kirkland, although they are recyclable in some larger cities like Seattle, so be sure to check local guidelines. 
    Furthermore, thin food wrappers with a shiny/aluminium apperance should typically be thrown away.</div>

    <div class="article-heading"> Outside Kirkland? </div>
    <div class="article-text" style="margin-bottom: 100px;"> If you live in a city other than Kirkland, these guidelines
      should still mostly apply (with the exception of tin foil and pie trays, which can be recyclable elsewhere).</div>
